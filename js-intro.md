# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: It's a block of code designed to perform a certain task. 

  Researched answer:A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.


2. What is a method?

  Your answer:It is a property that contains function definition.

  Researched answer: It is a shorthand for a function assigned to the method's name. JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.


3. List 5 examples of JavaScript string methods.

  Your answer:toUpperCase, concat, charAt, trim, indexOf

  Researched answer: JavaScript methods and properties are also available to primitive values, because JavaScript treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties.All string methods return a new value. They do not change the original variable.



4. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer:concat, slice,splice, join,reverse

  Researched answer:forEach, includes,filter, map, some, every


5. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Provide an example of each.

  Your answer: Assesor is a checker, mutator is a changer.

  Researched answer:Accessor method performs the action without modifying the original array.


6. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer:Return is returning values from a function, console.log is used for debugging/informative purposes.

  Researched answer: Console.log is a function that logs the arguments passed to the web console. Return is a statement which specifies the value returned from a function. 



7. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer:Argument is the condition for function. A variable is different properties you input into the function. 

  Researched answer:Arguments is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contain the values of the arguments passed to that function.An argument of a function is a specific input to the function. Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.  A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. 


8. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language that enables to perform complex things on the web.

  Researched answer:JavaScript is a programming language for he web, can update and change both HTML and CSS; can calculate, manipulate and validate the data.


9. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when code created by two people working together at the single computer.

  Researched answer: Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the “navigator”; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.
